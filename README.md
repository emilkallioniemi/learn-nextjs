# Next.js Learning Journey

## Introduction

Welcome to our Next.js Learning Journey! This repository is a collaborative project between myself (Emil) and my cousin (Sven). We're both diving into the world of Next.js, guided by the latest e-book from [nextjs.org/learn](https://nextjs.org/learn). This repository is our shared space for documenting our individual progress, exploring different solutions, and learning from each other.

Our goal is to master Next.js by engaging with the e-book, experimenting with its features, and building projects. We aim to develop our skills in web development and understand the diverse applications of Next.js through collaborative learning.

## Branches for Individual Work

- **Branch "emil"**: This branch contains all of my (Emil's) work. It includes my interpretations of the exercises, my code, and personal notes. It's a space for me to track my own progress and learning journey.
- **Branch "sven"**: Sven's work is housed in this branch. It showcases his approach to the same exercises and material, providing a different perspective and solutions.

By maintaining separate branches, we can both follow the guide independently while having the opportunity to review and learn from each other's code and approaches.
